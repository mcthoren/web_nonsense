leafmap.html:

* this is basically a collection of the leaflet map examples strung together into a simple map. so far it has a few layers, a scale, zoom, and when you click it shows you the lat/long.

* the layers are all from open and free sources.

* the layer sources and leaflet lib are all grabbed over https.

* the layer sources and leaflet lib are all IPv6 capable.

* i created this cuz i get tired of clicking thru Google's 27 different steps to opt out of their data collection, and openstreetmap tiles don't load too well thru ssh -D tunnels for me.
